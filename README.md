Object-Oriented Programming using Java

About

This repository contains my learning and practice of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

It includes:

Implementations of Java lab experiments (Semester 3)

Practice code for core OOP concepts

Learning and usage of abstraction, interfaces, and basic multithreading
